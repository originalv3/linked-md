# Week 1 What is a City
Urbs (physical space) and civitas (the exercise of citizenship rights).
## City
City : being larger in size or population, or having greater status, than a town

### Etymology
City (N.): “A large or important municipality.”  
Civitas: The whole body of cives, or members (Citizens), of any given state
Arise from political theory of the ancient Greek city-state & the classical Roman republic
Aristotle said a city was sharing of a common moral space

## Urban
Urban (Adj.): “characteristic of a town or city”  
Urbs: An area of mass assembly, originally a site of religious gathering and ritual and  
later a center for commercial transactions and exchange.

## Early Cities
The Indus River (India)  
The River Nile (Ancient Egypt)  
The Tigris & Euphrates River  (Mesopotamia) : Modern irrigation and walls around city with moat
The Yellow River (China)
Athens : Huge public stadium

were around water for agriculture and drinking

## 19th Century Industrial City
18th century ~ Early 19th century
Industrial cities created around cities with factories and profound resources

## Academic Definitions
Earliest urban dialogue was not really a dialogue at all but a one-way monologue of  
power from the king and the citadel class to their cowering subjects.  

Real dialogue developed slowly but irresistibly in the forum, the agora, and the  
neighborhood.

# Week 2 Urban Life
Goals for urban life:
Livability
Identity and Control
Access to opportunity, imagination, and joy

“City Proper” - according to an administrative boundary  
“Urban Agglomeration” - the extent of the contiguous urban area, or built-up area,  
to delineate the city’s boundaries.  
“Metropolitan area” - boundaries according to the degree of economic and social  
interconnectedness of nearby areas, identified by interlinked commerce or commuting  
patterns, for example.

Placemaking = process through which we collectively shape our public realm to  
maximize shared value

## Central Park
USA’s First landscaped public park
1800s New York City = Center of commercial and massive growth  
• 1807-1811: Discussion on passing Act on City lay out on streets and roads  
1853

## Gentrification
Gentry: people with relatively higher education levels and higher occupational status than  
their working-class neighbors  
Gentries buying and renovating old mews and cottages in certain neighborhoods

Generalized middle-class restructuring of place  
ntire transformation from low-status neighborhoods to upper-middle-class playgrounds.  
Newly built townhouses and high-rise apartments.  
Gentrifiers work in new downtown or docklands  
Retail and commercial precincts: Consumption-focused economic development  
Semi-public space

## Metropolis
Metro + Polis  
Metro (Meter) = Mother  
Polis = City  
= Mother-City

Political Sphere  
where the common issues of the community are discussed & where decisions are made

## Megalopolis
A group of several metropolitan areas that  
• Experienced significant growth and expansion  
• Is great/high in size, population density, complexity of transportation systems  
• Comprised of several cities, suburbs, counties, states  
• Interconnected in various ways
ex. BosWash

## Megacities
ex. LA
Toky

# Week 3 Small Urban Spaces
##  Rural
any region not urban 
Urban: Housing density of 2,000 housing units or 5000 people (2020)
![[Pasted image 20231011163438.png]]
A Metro area contains a core urban area of 50,000 or more population  
A Micro area contains an urban core of at least 10,000 population

## Suburban
Sub: under, close to  
• Urbs: City  
• Parts of urban areas located outside the city boundary  
• Often recognized as unpleasant, dangerous, polluting area  
• People who could not afford to live inside the city

Peripheral location – Edge of urban core  
• Relationship to urban core – Functional dependence, Political Independence  
• Relationship to the countryside – Aspiration of country living  
• Density – lower than urban core  
• Housing type – Single-family dwelling with gardens  
• Social segregation - class, race, ethnic  
• Transportation – commuting into the urban core

### Tiebout Model
• Consumer-voters are fully mobile and will move to that community where their  
preference patterns are best satisfied.  
• Consumer-voters are assumed to have full knowledge of differences among revenue  
and expenditure patterns and to react to these differences.  
• There are a large number of communities to choose from  
• Restrictions due to employment opportunities are not considered (Dividend Income)  
• The public services supplied exhibit no external economies or diseconomies between  
communities

# Week 4 Urban
## Urbanization
The mass movement of populations from rural(countryside) to urban(towns and cities)

based on population density, population size and contiguity using 1 km² (0.386  
mi²)grid cells.
![[Pasted image 20231011190943.png]]
### Urbanization and Economy
Division of labor : ↑ productivity from specialization  
• Efficiencies and Enhanced skills  
• More beneficial when external trade grows à competition intensifies  
• Economies of scale  
• Internal economies of scale : Internally, lower unit costs from larger-scale  
production  
• External economies of scale: Benefits from being close to other firms  
• Reduce transaction costs  
• Network effects (i.e - shared information, knowledge)  
• Localization economies: Closer to large labor pool, suppliers, customers and  
competitors within the same industry  
• Urbanization economies: Closer to other firms from other industries

### Civil Economy
Community lost: Development weakened social ties  
• Longer psychological distance from neighbors  
• Less anticipation of individual voice being directly reflected to policy  
• Distrust in the complex system  
• Variations in patterns of social ties: Social ties diversified and showed different format  
compared to the past  
• Size of the city does not necessarily matter  
• E-participation: i.e.) Zoom option for townhall meeting

basically people are less motivated to do things if they are far away

### urbanization and Health
Urbanization can positively affect public health  
• Increased living standards  
• Increased accessibility to and quality of medical services  
• Higher health insurance coverage  
• Improved sanitation facilities  
• Higher education level & Income à Public health  
• Urbanization can negatively affect public health  
• Environmental pollution (water, air, Co2 & Greenhouse Gas emission)  
• Mental illnesses: anxiety, emotional disorders  
• Changed diet & habits, obesity & overweight  
• Population crowding à medical treatment deficiency  
• Health Inequality inside urban areas

### animals
more likely to have animals in neighborhoods

Dogs raised in Urban living environment tend to appear more fearful  
• Physical distance closer to other dogs / Lack of physical Activity  
• Air pollution  
• Obesity

==URBAN IS THE CITY==

### environment
Urban stream syndrome: ecological degradation of streams draining urban land  
• flashy hydrograph  
• high concentrations of nutrients and contaminants  
• altered channel morphology and stability  
• reduced biotic richness,  
• increased dominance of invasive tolerant species

urban areas are hot
## Urbanism
### Urbanism
The way of life found in the modern city : Urban culture & Urban Society  
• (a) Large (numbers of population)  
• (b) Dense (density of settlement)  
• (c) Heterogeneous (heterogeneity of inhabitants and group life)  
• Enable observation and quantitative research of urban areas  
• Fluid and competitive  
• Varies with places and times

### Urban design
#### Garden City
Ebenezer Howard

during industrial revolution

Utopian Vision of the Mixture of City and Country life  
• “a group of slumless, smokeless cities”  
• Economic & Social benefit of City  
• Tranquility, healthful environment, proximity to nature of countryside

Three Magnets  
• ==Town Magnet==: advantages of  
high wages, job opportunities,  
abundant amusement  
• ==Country Magnet==: nature,  
comfort, community, pure air  
• ==Town-Country== Magnet:  
nature + social opportunity,  
low rent + high wage  
• Strongest magnet that  
attract people

rail system, mini "islands" around main island

6000 total
5000 agriculture 
1000 central
32k residents
6 seperate areas

Problems  
• Expensive  
• Simply urban sprawl (Bed town)  
• Lack of walkability  
• Equitable development: mostly beneficial for middle-high income class

#### City Beautiful Movement
Main Idea
Improved sanitation and traffic, addition of civic centers, parks, public spaces, civic  
art à make cities more profitable & harmonious
Combining parks and landscape architecture

Washington D.C  
• 1902 McMillan Plan for Washington, D.C.  
• Combining civic art and park planning into a scheme of municipal improvement  
• Transit, slum clearance, playgrounds, and scenic preservation  
• Before: Pierre L’Enfant (1791) plan for a great capital city – grand Mall idea  
• Broken up by new gardens & railroad stations

#### New Urbanism
Backround:
1950's brought highways and vehicles

Goal:
Return of Human-scaled neighborhoods  
• Diversity & in-fill, walkability, sustainability  
• community building, quality of life  
• Prevent urban sprawl

Model:
High-density development, mixed land use, public-transit oriented, pedestrian-  
oriented design (European Model)  
• Traditional Neighborhood Design (TND) – public spaces,  
• Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)  
• Mixed-Use District (MUD)

# Week 5 transportation
## Fun facts (probably not that important)
first gas automobile: Benz Patent Motor Car (1886)

first funded road : National road 1811-1834

## Urban Mobility
Important social resource  
• Movement of people between different socio-spatial hierarchies  
• Greatly affected income, employment, gender, age, local transport modal type, etc.  
• Urban Mobility  
• Collective Transportation (public transit)  
• Individual Transportation (Automobile, walking, cycle, motorcycle)  
• Freight Transportation (Delivery trucks, city logistics)

Factors  
• Sustainability: Keeping wellbeing of citizens and reducing the environmental impact  
• Road safety: Reducing Accidents  
• Increasing Public Health and reduce pollution  
• Road efficacy and intelligence: Smart City & 15-minute city  
• Urban space: Cities made for cars

## Automobiles
Traffic congestion  
• Accidents  
• Air pollution  
• Social inequalities  
• Sprawl  
• Divert money away from public transportation

Congestion Pricing  
• Levy price to reduce waste associated with traffic congestion  
• Variably priced lanes  
• variable tolls on separated lanes  
• Express Toll Lanes or HOT Lanes (High Occupancy Toll)  
• Variable tolls on entire roadways  
• Cordon charges  
• charges to drive within or into a congested area within a city  
• Area-wide charges  
• per-mile charges on all roads within congested area  
• Tags  
• No need to stop for Tolls  
• Electronic devices equipped on the vehicles

## Parking
Parking à ↑ value of residential, retail, multifamily, and commercial property  
• Keeping balance between parking spaces and population

4 parking options

## Electronic Vehicles
Around 4 millions EV in US  
• EV charging station: Around 58,000 stations around the US  
• CA the most (Around 15,000)  
• AK the least (Around 50)  
• IN has around 400

Infrastructure bill (2021) allocates $7.5 billion toward building 500,000 more public EV  
chargers by 2030

So, simply installing more EV charging station always better?  
• For some regions, NO.  
• Geography: Need to travel further than EV maximum range  
• Other options: Ethanol, Hydro-power, biofuel  
• Weather: Cold weather unsuitable for EV

## Urban Public Transportation
Urban transportation: modes: walking, bicycles, freeways, metro, regional rail systems  
• based on the type of their operation and use  
• (a) Private transportation: privately owned vehicles operated by owners for their  
personal use,  
• (b) Paratransit or for-hire transportation: Transportation provided by operators and  
available to parties which hire them for individual or multiple trips - i.e). Taxi, dial-a-  
bus  
• (c) Urban transit: Mass transit or public transportation  
• use by all persons who pay the established fare  
• operate on fixed routes  
• fixed schedules  
• Urban public transportation: includes both transit and paratransit categories  
• Another grouping:  
• Individual transportation: vehicle serves a separate party – private transportation  
• Group transportation: carries unrelated persons in the same vehicles – public  
transport system

## Types of public transit
bus
	easy
	economical
trolley
	faster, smoother
	high investment
	stuck on route
rail
	subways
	safe and economical
	very high investment



## Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Equity
Passenger:  
• Waiting, Riding, Transferring  
• Evaluate satisfaction, reliability, comprehension through information, experience,  
cost, social class  
• Agency/operator  
• Passenger demand, availability, cost à performance on speed, reliability, safety,  
service  
• Updating and sharing information, assigning vehicles and drivers, controlling  
schedule  
• Community/municipality/government  
• Routes and Stops, Interchanges, safety measures à increases safety, increased  
usage  
• Encourage using public transit, restricting movements

Minimum passenger waiting time: passenger perspective  
• Minimum empty seat/space time: agency perspective  
• Minimum time difference from shortest path: passenger & community perspective  
• Minimum fleet size
# Week 6 Housing

## Urban Design and Housing
Ville Radieuse (The Radiant City)
	Completely asymmetrical masterplan  
	• Designed to contain effective transportation, abundance of green space and  
	sunlight, better lifestyle, better society  
	• A city to function as a “living machine.”  
	• A strict division of the city into segregated commercial, business, entertainment  
	and residential areas with business district located in the center  
	• Sky-Scrapers  
	• First suggest the idea of apartment buildings (Unités)

Mobility of the city
	Continuous walkability of a city

## Housing
Housing is often the single largest item in a family’s budget  
• Housing is often the most expensive possession that people acquire
Affordability = Balancing the cost of its actual or potential housing to non-housing  
expenditures within the constraints of its income  
• Relationship between the people and housing  
• Ratio of housing cost to income: indicator of housing affordability

## Neighborhood
A unit that matches the daily scale of most people’s lives  
• Purpose: provide a convenient and safe daily lives  
• Traditionally: Area that would contain a population sufficient to supply the pupils for  
one elementary school  
• For 1000-1200 pupils  
• Total population of 5,000-6,000  
• Design street pattern to serve the residents and discourage through traffic  
• Common areas for residents to encounter each other and improve social relationships
## Abandoned Houses
Late 1990s: Housing price in the US began to rise very rapidly  
• In 2006, housing prices peaked and then crashed  
• = Bubble burst
# Week 7 Housing and Zoning

unit
## Living Environment
National Walkability Index (EPA): measures the relative walkability  
• Based on the “Smart Location Database (SLD)”  
• A compiled nation-wide data set describing transportation and land use  
characteristics

Parks are good
