Starting from the bottom down get rid of all of the negative coefficients by manipulating rows

Absolutely, I'd be happy to explain the steps I took to solve the system of linear equations using row operations.

Given augmented matrix:

`1 -1  0  0  -4 
0  1 -3  0  -7 
0  0  1 -3  -1 
0  0  0  2   4`

Step 1: Divide Row 4 by 2. The goal of this step is to simplify the coefficients in the last row. Dividing each entry in Row 4 by 2 doesn't change the solutions of the system, but it makes the calculations easier. This step is often done to ensure that the leading coefficient in the last row is 1, which is a desirable property for the reduced row-echelon form.

Resulting matrix:

`1 -1  0  0  -4 
0  1 -3  0  -7 
0  0  1 -3  -1 
0  0  0  1   2`

Step 2: Add 3 times Row 4 to Row 3. In this step, the purpose is to eliminate the coefficient below the leading coefficient (1) in the third row. By adding 3 times Row 4 to Row 3, we make the entry below the leading coefficient in Row 3 equal to zero, simplifying the matrix further.

Resulting matrix:

`1 -1  0  0  -4 
0  1 -3  0  -7 
0  0  1  0   5 
0  0  0  1   2`

Step 3: Add 3 times Row 3 to Row 2. The purpose of this step is similar to Step 2. By adding 3 times Row 3 to Row 2, we aim to eliminate the coefficient below the leading coefficient (1) in the second row.

Resulting matrix:

`1 -1  0  0  -4 
0  1  0  0   8 
0  0  1  0   5 
0  0  0  1   2`

Step 4: Add Row 2 to Row 1. In this final step, we add Row 2 to Row 1. This helps to eliminate the coefficient (-1) next to the leading coefficient (1) in the first row, simplifying the matrix even further.

Resulting matrix:

`1  0  0  0   4 
0  1  0  0   8 
0  0  1  0   5 
0  0  0  1   2`

At this point, the matrix is in reduced row-echelon form. Each row corresponds to an equation in the original system, and the values on the right side of the vertical bar correspond to the constants. The solution to the system is found by reading the values of x, y, z, and w directly from the rightmost column of the matrix.

S = \frac{(n + 1)(n - 1)}{2} + (n - 1)
= (n - 1) \left( \frac{n + 1}{2} + 1 \right)
