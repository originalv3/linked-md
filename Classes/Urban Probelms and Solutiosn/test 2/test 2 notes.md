## Global
Climate resilience  
	• Capacity of a system to maintain function in the face of stresses imposed by  
	climate change and to adapt the system to be better prepared for future climate  
	impacts

Climate Action Plan  
	• A dedicated roadmap that outlines actions and strategies for an agency to reduce  
	GHG emissions

## Sustainability
Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present  
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  
• Two key concepts:  
• Needs: Essential needs of the world's poor  
• Limitations: State of technology and social organization on the environment's ability  
to meet present and future needs

UN SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) (2015)  
• A shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet  
• Urgent call for action by all countries - Both developed and developing  
• Major focus  
• Ending poverty and other deprivations through improving health and education,  
reducing inequality, and spurring economic growth  
• Tackling climate change and Preserve our oceans and forests.

Environment, Economy, and Equity
## response
Mitigation: Reducing climate change by reducing the GHG emission  
• Reducing the sources of gases, or enhancing the capacity to store gases  
• Allowing the Earth and Human some time to adapt to climate change  
•  
• Adaptation: Adjusting to climate change by reducing the risk of harmful effects of  
climate change and/or making the most out of beneficial opportunities

# Art and City
## City Image
Making paths (leading people to somewhere) and edges (preventing people to have  
access to somewhere) clear can create more psychologically satisfying cities

Edges:
	Often Boundaries between two kinds of areas  
	Linear elements not considered as paths, shores, railroad cuts, walls

Districts:
	Medium-to-large sections of the city with some common & identifiable characters  
	Historic district, residential district, commercial district

Nodes:  
	strategic spots,  
	primarily junctions, places of a break in transportation, concentrations,  
	condensation of some use, enclosed square

## Changing Strategies
Traditionally: City planning and development focused on economic development,  
creating jobs, increasing productivity and growth of the region  
• More recently: Increased focus on People over companies  
• New ideas, innovation, human capital  
• Cities now need to attract high-quality human capital  
• provide amenities, consumption opportunities, quality of life
